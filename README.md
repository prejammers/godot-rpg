Starter godot project following this tutorial

This project uses a free sprite pack, you can find it here. 
https://game-endeavor.itch.io/mystic-woods
Simply download and place the sprites folder in the project's root folder at

res://sprites

DO NOT MOVE THESE FILES. 

Git is ingoring this sprites folder. We can use and refence it but we are not granted
the right to distribute those files, so you must install them locally and leave them in
the ignored folder.
